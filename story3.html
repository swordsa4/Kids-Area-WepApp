 This is the classic story of somebody who is a "bit different". We probably all know somebody at school is isn't quite accepted by the class. That is exactly what the "Ugly Duckling" in this story has to live with.

The duckling her isn't cute and yellow like the other baby ducks. Instead, he is tall, gray and awkward. The farmyard ducks don't like him - and he is so upset that he sets out on a journey across the moors all on his own, until, at the wonderful ending he finds his true self.

This story is a little longer than our usual audio - so sit back and let Hans Christian Andersen's wonderful writing - and Natasha's reading - transport you the countryside. This story has some out-door sound-effects to complete the atmosphere.

Read by Natasha. Duration 29. 18 Minutes.


It was summer in the land of Denmark, and though for most of the year the country looks flat and ugly, it was beautiful now. The wheat was yellow, the oats were green, the hay was dry and delicious to roll in, and from the old ruined house which nobody lived in, down to the edge of the canal, was a forest of prickly plants called burdocks so tall that a whole family of children might have dwelt in them and never have been found out.

It was under these burdocks that a duck had built herself a warm nest, and was not sitting all day on six pretty eggs. Five of them were white, but the sixth, which was larger than the others, was of an ugly grey colour. The duck was always puzzled about that egg, and how it came to be so different from the rest. Other birds might have thought that when the duck went down in the morning and evening to the water to stretch her legs in a good swim, some lazy mother might have been on the lookout , and have popped her egg into the nest. But ducks are not clever at all, and are not quick at counting, so this duck did not worry herself about the matter, but just took care that the big egg should be as warm as the rest.
