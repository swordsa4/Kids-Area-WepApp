 Puss in Boots has found renewed fame through his starring role in Shrek, but for many centuries he has been well known as one of the most cunning cats in all fairy tale literature. Like all cats though, he is more than just a fluffy bundle of cuddles. He has claws and he uses them. This is the Charles Perrault version, as presented in English by Andrew Lang. The pictures are by Walter Crane, and you might enjoy this flip book of some of the classic artists fairy tale illustrations.

Once upon a time there was a poor miller who had three sons. The years went by and the miller died, leaving nothing but his mill, his donkey, and a cat. The eldest son took the mill, the second-born son rode off on the donkey, and the youngest son inherited the cat.

“Oh, well,” said the youngest son, “I’ll eat this cat, and make some mittens out of his fur. Then I will have nothing left in the world and shall die of hunger.”

The cat was listening to his master complain like this, but he pretended not to have heard anything. Instead, he put on a serious face and said: “Do not look so sad, master. Just give me a bag and a pair of boots, and I will show you that you did not receive such a poor inheritance in me.”

The cat’s master had often seen him play a great many cunning tricks to catch rats and mice, as when he used to hang by the heels, or hide himself in the grain, and pretend to be dead. Thinking this over, he thought that it wasn’t impossible that the cat could help him after all, so he gave the cat his bag and spent his last pennies on ordering a fine pair of boots to be made especially for the cat.
