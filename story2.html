 A fox was walking through the forest when he saw a crow sitting on a tree branch with a fine piece of cheese in her beak. The fox wanted the cheese and decided he would be clever enough to outwit the bird.

      "What a noble and gracious bird I see in the tree!" proclaimed the fox, "What exquisite beauty! What fair plumage! If her voice is as lovely as her beauty, she would no doubt be the jewel of all birds."
       The crow was so flattered by all this talk that she opened her beak and gave a cry to show the fox her voice.
     "Caw! Caw!" she cried, as the cheese dropped to the ground for the fox to grab.
